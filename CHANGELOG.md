# Changelog

## 0.3.2 — 2026-06-22

- **다이얼로그 행/크래시 수정:** `connect_over_cdp`로 실제 브라우저에 붙을 때 ChatGPT 페이지의 JS 다이얼로그(beforeunload 등)가 playwright 기본 auto-dismiss와 레이스 → `ProtocolError: No dialog is showing` 미캐치 예외로 드라이버 크래시(100% CPU 스핀, 프롬프트 제출 실패). 페이지/컨텍스트에 다이얼로그 핸들러(`_guard_dialogs`)를 등록해 기본 auto-dismiss를 대체하고 레이스를 무시. 실제 ChatGPT 제출→응답 회수로 검증.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-06-22

Hardening of the v0.3.0 project grouping, from a GPT-5.5 Pro self-review of the new code:

- **True fallback on errors**: `ensure_project()` is now fully wrapped so any exception (DOM race, navigation timeout) returns `None` instead of propagating; `main()` then verifies the project composer actually loaded and otherwise falls back to a normal chat. Previously an exception aborted the whole run instead of degrading gracefully.
- **No more missed/duplicate projects**: project lookup now matches by the row's **displayed name** (language-agnostic, no longer depends on Korean `aria-label`s) and **scrolls the sidebar** until the target appears, so a virtualized/long project list no longer causes a same-named duplicate to be created. Create/submit buttons match ko/en/ja with an Enter-key fallback.
- **Path-scoped cache key**: the folder→project URL cache is keyed by `"{absolute path}::{name}"`, so two different folders that share a basename (or the same folder run with different `--project`) never collide.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-22

- Chats are now organized into a **folder-named ChatGPT Project** instead of piling up in the general chat list. Each run files its chat under a project matching the current folder name (one project per folder), so the main chat list stays clean.
- Resolution order is **cache → sidebar lookup → create**: the folder→project URL is cached per-repo in `.insane-review/projects.json`, so subsequent runs navigate straight to the project without touching the sidebar. Existing same-named projects are reused (no duplicates); missing ones are auto-created via the "새 프로젝트" modal.
- **Fail-safe**: if a project can't be resolved/created (unsupported plan, UI change, etc.) the run falls back to a normal chat instead of hard-failing. The whole attach / model-verify (GPT-5.5 Pro) / send / retrieve flow is unchanged — only *where* the chat lands.
- New flags: `--project "<name>"` (default = current folder name) and `--no-project` (disable grouping).

## 0.2.1 — 2026-06-21

- Added `setup/setup.sh` (first-run bootstrap): installs the marketplace update-notifier hook and auto-installs the Python deps (`pyperclip`, `playwright`) for the GPT-Pro web bridge. repomix still runs via `npx -y` (no preinstall); browser CDP launch + ChatGPT login stay in the command's interactive onboarding (Step 0.5).
- GitHub star is now opt-in via AskUserQuestion (네 / 아니요): asked once and recorded (`~/.gptaku-setup/insane-review.star.json`), never re-asked. The prompt is shown in the user's current language — falling back to the language detected from recent Claude sessions (else English) when there's no signal yet. No auto-star.

## 0.2.0

- GPT-5.5 Pro (web-only) bridge: repomix pack → subscription ChatGPT Pro via CDP → review retrieval. Standalone reviewer + agent-council web member.
